    So, TOP says to make a an image search site, but that'll be too easy and boring to show off to anyone. So I'll be using the Hearthstone API to make some sort of card name matching game.

    Wowie, fetch, promises and async/await are a nightmare to me right now. But somehow, I got it all working in an interactive way. I think it's not a bad idea that I went much heavier on this assignment, as I may need more practice with these in particular.

    Also, just to jinx myself, I'll say that this will be done by end of day tomorrow.

    By tomorrow, I meant today. Yesterday was the first day I took as a day off on purpose in a while. Not sick or anything, just a day off. Was real nice. Go play Witcher 3, it's real good.

    The hearthstone API I was using is down. I think hearthstone has an official API that I could try switching to, but it may be far easier to just use a set 9 cards to style the UI with and then reimplement the API when it's back up.

    Took one hour to find out the API issue and then replace it with hard-coded local cards. Probably better than spending a full day replacing the entire API. Of course, if the API doesn't start working again, then this was stupid as well.

    So, I guess if you refreshing saves your scroll position, and if you change your elements so that there is no longer scrolling, you will be locked scrolled partly down into nothing until the next hard refresh. Spent about an hour learning that.
