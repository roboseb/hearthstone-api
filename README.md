    So, TOP says to make a an image search site, but that'll be too easy and boring to show off to anyone. So I'll be using the Hearthstone API to make some sort of card name matching game.

    Wowie, fetch, promises and async/await are a nightmare to me right now. But somehow, I got it all working in an interactive way. I think it's not a bad idea that I went much heavier on this assignment, as I may need more practice with these in particular.

    Also, just to jinx myself, I'll say that this will be done by end of day tomorrow.


---To-Do---

-Custom sound effects
DONE-Draw ten random cards
CANCEL-Maybe select by card set?
DONE-Ignore cards that are not collectible
-theme UI to reporpoised phantasies
-Add cool pack opening animations
-Add fun effects
-add timer
-maybe give no options to make this a cool, but brief project
-Dom elements bounce to the beat like in mario, but cooler
-hide either card art or text, randomly, but always cost
